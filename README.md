# ESP32Workshop
This repository is intended for the workshop on ESP32 conducted in CZITT in Warsaw, Poland.
The agenda of this repo is to have a basic understanding of the ESP board series and the hands on experience at the workshop.
Before we begin it is advisable to download a set of drivers for ease of use and for obvious reasons.

* The Arduino IDE [link](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
* ESP32 core files installation for windows [link](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/blob/master/docs/arduino-ide/windows.md)
* ESP32 core files installation for Linux   [link](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/blob/master/docs/arduino-ide/debian_ubuntu.md)

All the code written here have been tested on the ESP32 boards and have performed as per the requirements for this workshop. Please note that it is advisable to have the drivers already installed on your computer before the workshop to save time.

**Happy coding :)**

# ESP32Workshop
This repository is intended for the workshop on ESP32 conducted in CZITT in Warsaw, Poland.
The agenda of this repo is to have a basic understanding of the ESP board series and the hands on experience at the workshop.
Before we begin it is advisable to download a set of drivers for ease of use and for obvious reasons.

# ESP32Workshop
This repository is intended for the workshop on ESP32 conducted in CZITT in Warsaw, Poland.
The agenda of this repo is to have a basic understanding of the ESP board series and the hands on experience at the workshop.
Before we begin it is advisable to download a set of drivers for ease of use and for obvious reasons.

* The Arduino IDE [link](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)

* ESP32 core files installation for Linux   [link](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/blob/master/docs/arduino-ide/debian_ubuntu.md)
* ESP32 core files installation for Mac     [link](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/blob/master/docs/arduino-ide/mac.md)
* GIT GUI for windows [link](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
* The ESP32 source files repository [link](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32)
